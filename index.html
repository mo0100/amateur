        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour,yeat together first for a minute ,then add half the water ,pay attention just half don't put all the water at once .you can do that in a bowl or in a mixer .mixer is way easier .obvisely .
            <li>after about 3 to 4 minutes add a little bit of water ,keep adding water bit by bit while mixing for about 20 minutes until all dough get together in the mixer as one pieace.</li>
            <li> Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>now,leave the dough coverd for an hour .</li>
            <li>time flies,after one hour cut dough to three equal part .it will make about 280 Grams per ball ,make dough round as a ball by folding the dough.</li>
            <li>put the pizza balls in airtigh containers and place in fride ,yes fridge ,keep in fridge for 24 hours if you want to keep it there for a week .go nuts.</li>
            <li>after 24 hours ,I keep mine for 48 hours btw, take the dough out of fridge and let get to room tempature about one to two hours .I don't know how cold or hot your room is.</li>
            <li>while waiting on the dough place your pizza stone in the middle rack,turn on your oven on the highest it can get .500F or 550 .</li>
            <li>touch your pizza dough to make sure it's room tempeture then add some flour to the work are ,and spred your dough by pushing air from the center to the edges to create the crust</li>
<li> add your favorate pizza sauce , and place your pizza in the oven,yes I know I haven't added any topping yet .home ovens don't get super hot so you have to do two s.</li>
<li>keep an eye on the pizza because it won't take long at this stage ,once the crust starts to get some color about 3 or 4 minutes take the pizza out  .</li>
<li>add frsh modzarella and some parmesan chesse and some fresh basil and olive oil,once the cheese stra .</li>
